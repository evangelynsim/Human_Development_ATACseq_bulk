## Introduction

Nuclei ATAC-seq generates sequencing reads that map across a whole gene (intron and exon). Reference genome targeting 1kbp up-/down-stream of transcription start site was generated to allow the idenfication of genes from DNA sequencing reads.


```{bash}
#!/bin/bash

grep -w gene *.gtf | cut -f1,4,5,7,9| cut -d '"' -f-2,6 \
        | sed 's/gene_id "//' | tr '"' '_'\
        | awk '{OFS="\t"}  {print $5,$1,$2,$3,$4}' > Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.96.fulllength.saf

```
